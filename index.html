        <h1>What is Object Oriented Programming?</h1>
		
		<p>Object Oriented Programming is a very useful construct and its immense popularity follows as a result. 
		An understanding of OOP is indispensable in today's programming scene.</p>
		
		<p>Object oriented programming can be very similar in implementation to procedural programming, 
		but as we will see, it comes with new syntax adding a layer of abstraction and improving compartmentalization.</p>
		
		<p>Grouping data and methods.</p>
		<h2>Procedural Programming</h2>
		
		<p>Discussed in the previous course, procedural programming is a very simple and effective 
		method of writing code. However, there are limitations to its capabilities.</p>
		
		<!--
		<pre>
<code># A recursive function to calculate the nth fibonacci number
def fibonacci(n):
  if(n <= 1):
    return n
  else:
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
		
fib = fibonacci(50)

print(fib)</code>
		</pre>
		-->
            
        <br/>
		<iframe height="800px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@ststraining/Recursive-Fibonacci-Example?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
		
		<p>Let's say you have a ball and you want to keep track of its x, y, and z locations.
		Using strictly procedural programming and the existing simple data types, you would have 
		to write something like this:</p>
		
		<!--
		<pre>
<code>from math import sqrt
		
# Increments a position
def move(x):
  x += 1
  return x
		
# Ball properties
ballX = 0
ballY = 0
ballZ = 0

for i in range(32):
  # Format string for easy printing.
  print("Ball Position: x=%d, y=%d, z=%d" % (ballX, ballY, ballZ))
  ballX = move(ballX)
  ballY = move(ballY)
  ballZ = move(ballZ)
	
# Print the distance from the start position
# Uses the Pythagorean theorem
print("\nThe ball ended up %d meters away from where it started." % sqrt(ballX**2 + ballY**2 + ballZ**2))</code>
		</pre>
		-->
        <br/>
		<iframe height="800px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@ststraining/Procedural-Ball-Example?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
		
		<p>While the above example might not be that terrible, in a real program, the ball may have an image associated with it, 
		as well as a width, height, depth, velocity, acceleration, jerk, mass, the original x, y, and z 
        locations, and even more.</p>

        </section>
        
        <section class="topic">
		<h1>Objects</h1>
        
        <p>Seeing how messy strictly procedural programming can get, this is where Object Oriented Programming shines. 
        With OOP, you can group variables and functions together into a "blueprint" or "skeleton"-like structure which you can then 
        build "objects" from. Essentially, you're creating a data type that has multiple "member variables" or "fields" with each instance this type having
        its own unique values.</p>
        
        <img src="images/OOP_Example.jpg" alt="Items can be broken down into attributes and actions."></img>
        
        <h2>Structures</h2>
		
		<p>One thing that Python lets us do is group variables together into a single structure, which is 
		very helpful when it comes to organization. This is called a "class".</p>
		
		<pre>
<code># Creating a Ball class
class Ball:
  # Ball attributes
  x = 0
  y = 0
  z = 0
  
# Creating a new instance of a Ball
# Similar looking to a function call
ball = Ball()

print("The ball's position: x=%d, y=%d, z=%d" % (ball.x, ball.y, ball.z))
</code>
		</pre>
		
		<p>Perhaps you want to be able to choose where the ball starts. To do so, we need to add a 
		"constructor". A constructor is a function within a class that is run whenever a new
		instance of that class is created. In python the syntax might look a bit cryptic,
		but its really just like any other function, just with a strange name. It takes the parameter
		"self", which can be any name that you want, but it is conventionally "self" to avoid
		confusion. The "self" parameter is a reference to the ball object that is being created,
		thus the name "self".</p>
		
		<pre>
<code># Creating a Ball class
class Ball:
  # Ball attributes
  x = 0
  y = 0
  z = 0
  
  # Ball constructor. Runs every time a new ball is created
  def __init__(self, x, y, z):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y
    self.z = z
  
# Creating a new instance of a Ball
# Similar looking to a function call
ball = Ball(20, 30, 40)

print("The ball's position: x=%d, y=%d, z=%d" % (ball.x, ball.y, ball.z))
</code>
		</pre>
		
		<div class="good-to-know" style="float: right;">
			<p>
				A default argument is an argument that has a default value
				if no value is specified.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>It is worth noting that when you create a ball object, you only need to pass the parameters after "self".
		This is because "self" is automatically passed by the interpreter when you use the <span class="type-text">ball.x</span> (instance.field) syntax. In other programming languages, 
		"self" is often written as "this" and is an implicit (read hidden) parameter, but in Python, 
		the parameter is explicit and must be in every method's (a function within a class) declaration.</p>
		
		
		
		<p>Like every function in Python, constructors can have default arguments. 
        This is Python's version of "function overloading" (a common feature in other languages).
        You can use this to specify default values for parameters so that the user need only override what they 
        want to change.</p>
		
		<!--
		<pre>
<code># Creating a Ball class
class Ball:
  x = 0
  y = 0
  z = 0
  
  def __init__(self, x = 0, y = 0, z = 0):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y
    self.z = z
  
# Creating a new instance of a Ball
# Similar looking to a function call
ball1 = Ball(20, 30, 40)

# Calling the constructor with no arguments
ball2 = Ball()

print("ball1's position: x=%d, y=%d, z=%d" % (ball1.x, ball1.y, ball1.z))
print("ball2's position: x=%d, y=%d, z=%d" % (ball2.x, ball2.y, ball2.z))
</code>

        <h2>Classes</h2>
        
        <p>Up until now, we've been using objects entirely as structures (containers for variables), 
        but we can also have our objects contain functions which are called, "methods". Methods,
        like constructors, also take the "self" parameter which is used in much the same way.</p>
        
        <pre>
<code>from math import sqrt

# Creating a ball class
class Ball:
  x = 0
  y = 0
  z = 0
   
  # Ball constructor
  def __init__(self, x, y, z):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y
    self.z = z
    
  # Ball method
  def move(self):
    self.x += 1
    self.y += 1
    self.z += 1
  
# Create a new instance of Ball  
ball = Ball(0, 0, 0)

# Loop 32 times
for i in range(32):
  # Format string for easy printing.
  print("Ball Position: x=%d, y=%d, z=%d" % (ball.x, ball.y, ball.z))
  # A single function call instead of three
  ball.move()
	
# Print the distance from the start position
# Uses the Pythagorean theorem
print("\nThe ball ended up %d meters away from where it started." % sqrt(ball.x**2 + ball.y**2 + ball.z**2))</code>
        </pre>
        
        <p>While this may not look much neater than its original counterpart, once you start using multiple objects
        there is a significant difference in both readability and succinctness as you can see in the below example.</p>

        <h1>Encapsulation vs Inheritance</h1>
		
		<p>When creating objects, there are two main ways to organize the code amongst them.
		One method is known as "Encapsulation", the other, "Inheritance". We'll first go into encapsulation, then 
		take a look at inheritance.</p>
		
		<div class="good-to-know" style="float:right;">
		<p>Keyword arguments are arguments that are explicitly referenced when the function is called such as in the 
		<span class="type-text">moveBall(x = 50)</span> example.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2>Encapsulation</h2>
		
		
		
		<p>When creating objects, we can put variables inside of them called, "fields". 
		You may be wondering if we can put objects inside of our objects, and the answer is yes.
		This concept is called encapsulation.</p>
		
		
		<!--
		<pre>
<code># Create a ball class
class Ball:
  x = 0
  y = 0
  z = 0

  # A function that moves the player's ball
  def moveBall(self, x = 0, y = 0, z = 0):
    self.x += x
    self.y += y
    self.z += z

# Create a player class
class Player:
  # The player has a ball
  ball = Ball()

  # A function to throw the player's ball
  def throwBall(self):
    # Uses keyword arguments
    self.ball.moveBall(x = 50)

# Create a new player
player = Player()

# Have the player throw his ball
player.throwBall()

# Print the player's ball's new position
print(player.ball.x)</code>
			</pre>
		-->
		<br/>
		<iframe height="800px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@ststraining/Encapsulation-Full-Example?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
		
		<h2>Inheritance</h2>
		
		<p>Now that we've seen encapsulation, it's time to take a look at inheritance. With inheritance, we can
		use the methods and fields of a "parent" class within a "child" class that inherits from it.</p>
		
		<p>Imagine you have a "Vehicle" class which perhaps has some fields like "position" and "speed". With inheritance,
		we can create a "Bicycle" class which inherits from "Vehicle" and consequently, does not need to define those
		fields, but instead only the fields specific to a bicycle.</p>
		
		<img src="images/vehicles_classification.png" alt="Classes can be categorized and inherit traits from their category."></img>
		
		<p>In Python, inheritance can be achieved by putting the name of the class you want your subclass 
		to inherit from in parenthesis after the declaration of the subclass much like defining parameters of a function. 
		Here is a simple example using inheritance.</p>
		
		<!--
		<pre>
<code># Create a ball class
class Ball:
  x = 0
  y = 0
  z = 0

  # A function that moves the player's ball
  def moveBall(self, x = 0, y = 0, z = 0):
    self.x += x
    self.y += y
    self.z += z

# Create a beach ball class
# The beach ball is a ball
class BeachBall(Ball):
  color = "blue"

# Create a new beachBall
beachBall = BeachBall()

# Have the beachBall move
beachBall.moveBall(5,5,5)

# Print the beach ball's new position
print(beachBall.x)

# Print the beach ball's color
print(beachBall.color)</code>
		</pre>
		-->
        <br/>
		<iframe height="800px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@ststraining/Inheritance-Full-Example?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
		
		<h2>"Is a" vs "Has a" relationship.</h2>
		
		<p>Now that we've talked about both encapsulation and inheritance, it is important to make the distinction
		between the "Is a" vs the "Has a" relationship. The "Is a" relationship is used when a class derives from a
		superclass, while the "Has a" relationship pertains to encapsulation.</p>
		
		<p>When deciding whether to use encapsulation or inheritance, ask yourself whether the object "Is"
		or "Has" another object. For example: a bicycle <strong>is a</strong> vehicle, but it <strong>has a</strong> seat.</p>
        </section>
		
		<section class="topic">
		<h1>Polymorphism</h1>
		
		<p>Polymorphism is a helpful trait of object oriented programming in Python. Essentially, polymorphism is the
		ability to call methods specific to each class that is being referred to while not having to change your code.</p>
		
		<h2>Method Overriding</h2>
		
		<p>As we learned, when a class inherits from another class, it gains all of the methods and fields of the class that it inherited 
		from. However, there may be scenarios in which you may want to change some of the parent's functionality 
		in the child class. This can be accomplished through a process called method overriding.</p>
		
		<p>Overriding is achieved by naming the child class' method the same as the parent class'. When this occurs, 
		the interpreter uses the child's implementation of the method, and ignores the parent's.</p>
		
		<pre>
<code># Create parent class Ball
class Ball:
  # Old roll method
  def roll(self):
    print("Ball's roll")

# Create a child class
class BowlingBall(Ball):
  # Override the old roll method
  def roll(self):
    print("Bowling ball's roll")

# Create a new instance of a bowling ball
ball = BowlingBall()

# Call the bowling ball's roll method
ball.roll()</code>
		</pre>
		
		
		<p>Often there are times where you want to override a method, but still be able to use the parent's method. 
		There are a few ways to accomplish this. One way is to use Python's <span class="type-text">super()</span> proxy object 
		which returns a reference to the parent class with respect to the current object that we can then use to call the 
		parent class' methods. The other is to directly specify the name of the class 
		that you want to call the method of, followed by the method name and passing it a reference to the current instance 
		that you want the operations performed on.</p>
		
		<!--
		<pre>
<code># Create parent class Ball
class Ball:
  posX = 0
  posY = 0
  # Old roll method
  def roll(self):
    print("Ball's roll")

# Create a child class
class BowlingBall(Ball):
  # Override the old roll method
  def roll(self):
    # Call the old method using the super function and calling
    super().roll()
	
# Create a child class
class GolfBall(Ball):
  # Override the old roll method
  def roll(self):
    # Call the old method using the parent class name and passing the self parameter
    Ball.roll(self)

# Create a new instance of a bowling ball
bBall = BowlingBall()

# Create a new instance of a golf ball
gBall = GolfBall()

# Call the bowling ball's roll method
bBall.roll()

# Call the golf ball's roll method
gBall.roll()</code>
		</pre>
		-->
		<br/>
		<iframe height="800px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@ststraining/Override-Full-Example?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
		
		<p>Essentially, if you want to call the parent classes method in your child method you can do 
		<span class="type-text">super().parentMethod()</span>,
		Or you can explicitly call <span class="type-text">ParentClass.parentMethod(self)</span></p>
		
		<h2>Polymorphic Functions</h2>
		
		<p>Let's suppose you have a function which takes an instance of a class containing a "roll" method. 
		In Python, we can simply call the "roll" method on whatever is passed into the function, and if it has a 
		"roll" method, the method will be called, otherwise and exception will be thrown.</p>
		
		<pre>
<code># Create parent class Ball
class Ball:
  # Old roll method
  def roll(self):
    print("Ball's roll")

# Create a child class
class BowlingBall(Ball):
  # Override the old roll method
  def roll(self):
    print("Bowling ball's roll")
	
def rollIt(rollable):
  rollable.roll()

# Create a new instance of a bowling ball
bBall = BowlingBall()

# Create a new instance of a ball
ball = Ball()

# Call rollIt with each rollable object
rollIt(bBall)
rollIt(ball)</code>
		</pre>
		
		<p>While this is a very useful technique, it can cause problems as soon as we pass it something that does 
		not have a roll method. In that case, it will throw an exception. If we wanted to check for that case programmatically,
		Python has a function called <span class="type-text">hasattr(object, name)</span> which we can use to check if an object 
		has the method that we are trying to call before we try to call it.</p>
		
		<!--
		<pre>
<code># Create parent class Ball
class Ball:
  # Old roll method
  def roll(self):
    print("Ball's roll")

# Create a non-rollable class
class Cube:
  def notRoll():
    print("I can't roll!")
	
def rollIt(rollable):
  if(hasattr(rollable, "roll")):
    rollable.roll()
  else:
    print("Object not rollable!")

# Create a new instance of a ball
ball = Ball()

# Create a new instance of a cube
cube = Cube()

# Call rollIt with each object
rollIt(ball)
rollIt(cube)</code>

            <h1>Useful Tricks</h1>
            
            <p>In the previous manual, we looked a the basics of using Python. We learned that Python is a very powerful high level 
                language and talked about many of its features. In this manual, we'll examine a few more of those features before
            moving on to the primary topic of Object Oriented Design.</p>
            
            <h2>Ternary Expressions</h2>
            
            <p>A ternary expression is an expression that takes three operands. Essentially what that means is that there are 3 things
            will need to keep track of when using a ternary expression. A simple ternary expression can be used as follows:</p>
            
            <pre>
<code># Using a ternary expression
starting = True

# Prints Hello because starting is True
print("Hello" if starting else "Goodbye")

starting = False

# Prints Goodbye because starting is False
print("Hello" if starting else "Goodbye")
</code>
		</pre>
            
            <p>This is different than the way that ternary expression are written in many other languages, but it works in much 
            the same way. All you need is an <span class="type-text">if</span> and an <span class="type-text">else</span> keyword with
            an expression on the left, a condition in between, and an expression on the right. If the condition evaluates to true, the 
            expression on the left is the result, but if the condition evaluates to false, then the expression on the right is the result.</p>
            
            <h2>List Comprehensions</h2>
            
            <p>A list comprehension in Python is a quick and simple way to initialize a list with the values you want in one line of code.
            This can be very useful if have a simple algorithm that you want to follow to create a list, but it is not wise to use if you
            have something very complex because it can get difficult to read. The following is an example of a list comprehension:</p>
            
            <pre>
<code># Using a list comprehension
# Generates the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# Comprehension
myList = [i for i in range(5)]

# Print the list
print(i)

# Not using a list comprehension
# Generates the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# Initialize empty list
myList = []

# Add items to the list
for i in range(5):
    myList.append(i)
    
# Print the list
print(myList)
</code>
		</pre>
            
            <p>As you can see, it is much shorter than its counterpart which doesn't use this technique, but it might also be difficult
            to understand if you haven't seen this before. In order to perform a list comprehension, you must have a for loop inside
            of the list initialization brackets i.e. <span class="type-text">[]</span>. Each iteration of the for loop refers to an
            entry in the new list. Whichever item you want to be in the list during that iteration you put to the left of the for loop.
            In this case, I want item <span class="type-text">i</span> in <span class="type-text">range(5)</span> to be the <span class="type-text">ith</span> element of the list.</p>
            
            <p>List comprehensions can be used to generate multidimensional lists and have the potential to get very complicated, but for
            the sake of simpilicity, we'll stop talking about list comprehensions here. If you're are interested in learning more about them,
            there are many resources available online which can show you much more complicated use cases.</p>

        <h1>Special Objects</h1>
            <p>Moving on from the general idea of object oriented design, we will take a look at some interesting kinds of objects that see
            widespread use in Python. </p>
            <h2>Iterators</h2>
                <p> A common useful feature of object oriented programming is the concept of iterators. In its simplest form, an iterator
                is an object that implements the <span class="type-text">__next__()</span> method.</p>
                <p>Iterators are obtained from an object called an iterable. An iterable object implements the <span class="type-text">__iter__()</span>
                method which is intended to return an instance of an iterator.</p>
            
<pre>
<code># Create an iterator class
class myIterator():

  # Define the __next__() method
  def __next__(self):
  
    # This is how an iterator signals that the
    # end has been reached
    raise StopIteration

# Create an iterable class
class myIterable():

  # Define the __iter__() method which returns
  # an instance of an iterator
  def __iter__(self):
    return myIterator()</code>
</pre>
            
                <p>
                    Iterators are used very frequently in Python and in other languages. In fact, by this point, chances are you have used iterators, in some form or another, several times without explicitly intending to. The <span class="type-text">for</span> loop in Python takes an iterable as its righthand argument and this loop implicitly calls the <span class="type-text">__next__()</span> method of the returned iterator setting the lefthand variable to this value before every iteration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Iterators are a very useful feature because they allow the programmer to accomplish farily complicated tasks in a simple and elegant way. A good example of this is that they allow the programmer to break up the work involved in traversing a data structure into simple discreet steps. This means that you could be trying to loop through every element in a linked-list (a kind of data structure in which a node links to another node in a chain) and simply use the start of the list as the righthand argument of a <span class="type-text">for</span> loop. Another example is that they provide the potential to conveniently generate infinite sequences of items on the fly. This could be accomplished, for instance, through a <span class="type-text">__next__()</span> method which just returns the previous number plus one.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    As we can see, iterators are a very useful tool to keep in mind when writing in Python.
                </p>
            
            <h2>Generators</h2>
                <p> Generators are very similar to functions in Python, but with a distinct difference: where functions return a completed result, generators yield small completed sections of the result with subsequent sections being retrieved in subsequent calls. Essentially, what this means is that generators, like iterators, allow the programmer to avoid doing large, costly operations all at once, and instead break apart the work of the operation into seperate smaller pieces.</p>

            <h2>Lambdas</h2>
            
                <p>Lambas in Python are a special kind of object. They act very similar to a function, but can be stored as variables and passed as parameters. There are some limitations to lambdas in Python, but they open a lot of new an interesting possibilities for programming which is more dynamic. Below is an example of a lambda expression.</p>
<pre><code># Adds two numbers
lambda x, y : x + y</code>
</pre>
                <p>
                    As we can see, a lambda expression is made by using the keyword lambda followed by the parameters, then a colon, then the expression which the lambda is meant to evaluate to. Because lambda expressions are essentially simple functions that you can store in variables, they allow for quite a few possibilities. The programmer can pass lambda expressions as arguments to functions, store lambda expressions in objects, have an list of lambda expressions which can be sequentially applied, or use them any number of other possible applications. 
                </p>

        <h1>Modules</h1>
		
		<p>Modules are the Python version of "libraries" which are, essentially, files containing code that you
		or someone else wrote that can be used within other Python programs.</p>
		
		<h2>Creating Your Own Modules</h2>
		
		<p>When it comes to creating your own modules in Python, it's actually quite simple. Simply create a 
		Python file (<span class="type-text">*.py</span>) and refer to it from another file based on its relative directory.</p>
		
		<p>For instance, if you've created a file named <span class="type-text">Toys.py</span> containing a class 
		<span class="type-text">Ball</span> with a method <span class="type-text">moveBall</span>, and this file is 
		located in a subdirectory named <span class="type-text">lib</span>, there are several ways you could link
		this file to your program. Below are some examples.</p>
		
		<pre>
<code># Imports the Toys module from the lib directory
from lib import Toys

ball = Toys.Ball()</code>
		</pre>
		
		<pre>
<code># Imports the Ball class from lib.Toys
from lib.Toys import Ball

ball = Ball()</code>
		</pre>
		
		<pre>
<code># Imports everything from lib.Toys
from lib.Toys import *

ball = Ball()</code>
		</pre>
		
		<p>If your module is in the current directory of the program that you're running, you need only 
		<span class="type-text">import [module_name]</span></p>
		
		<p>Below is an example of module usage:</p>
            
        <br/>

		<!--<p>The if __name__ == "__main__": trick.</p>-->
		
		<!--<h2>Getting more modules (downloading and installing libraries)</h2>-->
		
		<h2>PIP</h2>
		
		<p>PIP is a great resource for installing Python libraries, and if you're running Python 2 >= 2.7.9 or 
		Python 3 >= 3.4, it comes pre-installed.</p>
		
		<p>To use PIP, simply open the command prompt and type <span class="type-text">pip install [name of library]</span></p>
		<p>PIP will automatically try to find the library that you typed and install it so that you jump right in and use it immediately.</p>
